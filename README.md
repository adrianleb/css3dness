=========

some magic using THREE.js + CSS3D renderer

## How to get started?


clone this bastard
```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:adrianleb/css3dness.git
```

install [yeoman](http://yeoman.io/)
```bash
$  curl -L get.yeoman.io | bash
```

thats pretty much all you need...

## How do I run this thing??

Easy, go to the root server and run:
```bash
$ yeoman server
```
It will 
 - start a local server, 
 - watch for changes on your files, 
 - compile coffee/sass,
 - refresh the browser window
 - and even open a browser tab for you after running that command
